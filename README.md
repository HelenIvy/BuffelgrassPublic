Buffelgrass removal project
In the data file:
BG Individuals.csv is the file for buffelgrass count data dating from 2019 to 2022, but do not include the invaded control plots.
Invaded control plots BG COUNT treated 2020 data.csv is the buffelgrasss count data from 2020 (when buffelgrass was first removed from these plots) through 2022 for only the invaded control plots
BG Richness.xlsx is the data file for native plant richness and includes all treatments, except the invaded control after spring 2020 when the treatment changed to split plot removal
Litter.xlsx is the data file for litter and includes all treatments, except the invaded control after spring 2020 when the treatment changed to split plot removal
Plant community cover.xls file is all plant community data except for the invaded control after spring 2020 when the treatment changed to split plot removal
Plant community cover2018ONLY.xls is the plant community cover.xls file with only 2018 to check for pre-treatment differences among plots
In all of these data sets, the invaded control for block 1 was removed because it did not meet the threshold of buffelgrass cover (only 7%)
